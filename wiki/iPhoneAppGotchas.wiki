#summary iPhone App Gotchas

= Introduction =

It was a tricky process getting our iPhone apps building and running on our iPod touch devices. Here are a few tips we learned along the way.


= Running ADC Examples =

Here's what I do every time I download something from Apple Developer Connection (ADC - http://developer.apple.com/ ) and want to run it on my device:

== Edit Info.plist ==
Modify the bundle identifier of your app to match our team's domain:

|| *Key* || *Value* ||
|| Bundle identifier || edu.ucsd.cse.${PRODUCT_NAME:identifier} ||


== Edit Project Settings ==

From the *Project* menu, select *Edit Project Settings*

Your variables should be the following (this is what copying straight out of the window produces):
{{{
CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY = iPhone Developer: John Kooker
CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY[sdk=iphoneos*] = iPhone Developer
PROVISIONING_PROFILE = DefaultProfileUuid
}}}
